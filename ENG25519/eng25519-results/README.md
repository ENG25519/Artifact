# ENG25519-Results

This project contains the raw experimental data in our paper and some data processing scripts.

`batch_keygen/`: This folder contains the CPU cycles of X25519-KeyGen under different `batch_size` on the server. For example, `s_b1_helper.txt` contains the CPU cycles of X25519-KeyGen with our auxiliary warm-up thread on the server when `batch_size=1`. `s_b1.txt` contains the CPU cycles of X25519-KeyGen on the server when `batch_size=1` without our auxiliary warm-up thread.

`cc_unbound/`: This folder contains the test results of cryptographic primitives under the DoT scenario. `c_unbound_helper.txt` contains the CPU cycles of cryptographic primitives with our auxiliary warm-up thread on the client (`dot_timer`). `c_unbound.txt` contains the CPU cycles of cryptographic primitives on the client (`dot_timer`) without our auxiliary warm-up thread. `s_unbound_helper.txt` contains the CPU cycles of cryptographic primitives with our auxiliary warm-up thread on the server (`unbound`). `s_unbound.txt` contains the CPU cycles of cryptographic primitives on the server (`unbound`) without our auxiliary warm-up thread.

`dot/`: This folder contains the test results of DoT (Figure 3 in our paper).
- `unbound_all_openssl.txt` corresponds to the `ALL_OpenSSL` legend.
- `unbound_p256.txt` corresponds to the `P256` legend.
- `unbound_swarm_ccold.txt` corresponds to the `ENG25519` legend.
- `unbound_x25519.txt` corresponds to the `X25519` legend.

`handshake/`: This folder contains the test results of TLS 1.3 handshake (Figure 3 in our paper).
- `server_all_openssl.txt` corresponds to the `ALL_OpenSSL` legend.
- `server_p256.txt` corresponds to the `P256` legend.
- `server_swarm_ccold.txt` corresponds to the `ENG25519` legend.
- `server_x25519.txt` corresponds to the `X25519` legend.

`cc.ipynb` with `batch_keygen/` and `cc_unbound/` is used to obtain results in Table 6 and 7 in our paper.

`plot.ipynb` with `dot/` and `handshake/` is used to plot Figure 3 in our paper. `dot.pdf` and `handshake.pdf` are the figures generated by `plot.ipynb`.
